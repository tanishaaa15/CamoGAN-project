# CamoGAN-project
The CamoGAN project successfully demonstrates the application of GANs to the  problem of camouflage. By leveraging the power of convolutional neural networks in  both the generator and discriminator, CamoGAN can produce highly realistic camouflaged images.
#Camouflage
Camouflage is a method used by animals, military applications, and other entities to blend into their surroundings, thereby reducing detection by observers. Effective camouflage patterns need to take into account the environment in which they will be used, optimizing colour, texture, and pattern to achieve maximum concealment.
#Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs)
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of machine learning frameworks designed to generate new data samples that are similar to a given dataset. Introduced by Ian Goodfellow in 2014, GANs consist of two neural networks, the Generator and the Discriminator, that compete against each other in a zero-sum game.
